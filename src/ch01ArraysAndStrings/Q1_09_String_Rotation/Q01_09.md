**1.9** String Rotation:Assumeyou have a method isSubstringwhich checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

<summary>Hint 1 (#34)</summary>
<p>If a string is a rotation of another, then it's a rotation at a particular point. For example,
a rotation of waterbottle at character 3 means cutting waterbottle at character 3
and putting the right half (erbottle) before the left half (wat).</p>

<summary>Hint 2 (#88)</summary>
<p>We are essentially asking if there's a way of splitting the first string into two parts, x and
y, such that the first string is xy and the second string is yx. For example, x = wat and
y = erbottle. The first string is xy = waterbottle. The second string is yx =
erbottlewat.</p>

<summary>Hint 3 (#104)</summary>
<p>Think about the earlier hint. Then think about what happens when you concatenate
erbottlewat to itself. You get erbottlewaterbottlewat.</p>
