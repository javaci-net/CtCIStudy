**1.4** Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
